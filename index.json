The above video demonstrates the initial version of my designed table recognition system (The content in this video was produced in 2021, but the technical implementation was achieved around 2018). The approach mainly relies on the implementation of DBnet[1] to detect the coordinates of the text within the table that needs to be extracted from the image. Based on these coordinates, the corresponding text images are sliced out. Subsequently, these text images are input into CRNN[2] for text recognition. Finally, some post-processing operations are applied to restore the style of the table. When using this system, the number of rows and columns of the table need to be inputted for display purposes in the frontend.\nIn other versions, we made some improvements based on the customer‚Äôs needs. The customer required that the text should be highlighted on the image when the mouse clicks on it. Therefore, some modifications were made to the post-processing of CRNN [2]. The code is as follows:\ntotal_axis = [] # create an empty list to store the coordinates of each character recognized in the image tmp = np.array(im) # convert the image into a numpy array i = 0 # set the index to 0 color= (255, 0, 0) # set the color to blue c = color for index, box in enumerate(boxes): # loop through each detected text box # if index \u0026gt;
